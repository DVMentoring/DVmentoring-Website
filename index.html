    <p>At Dieu Vivant, we are determined to create a rich learning environment with the aim 
      of stimulating your child’s physical, social, emotional, and intellectual growth as an added 
      value to the Education Standards recommended by the Ghana Education System. Each child should be 
      receiving and provided with experiences that enhance confidence and spark their imagination, which 
      is essential in the growing stages of child development regardless of which standards they should follow. 
      This approach ensures that each child’s learning experience will be nurtured at the proper pace and will 
      give them a strong educational foundation for a bright future. </p>
      
      <p>Our goal is to continuously push the boundaries to build a strong foundation for growth by providing 
        developmentally appropriate add-ons to the National Curriculum so that each year, what the kids are learning 
        goes beyond what is prescribed. We are a school that likes to be flexibility and try new things and that is 
        why at any given moment you show up to the school, you might find guest staff, guest students from abroad 
        sitting in on classes or participating in projects, or giving students the freedom to experiment.</p>
      
      <p>We have both a domestic and an international group of advisors deep rooted in education research and childhood 
    development and have started focusing a lot of our learning programs on collaborative learning experiences.</p>

    <p>This school was built on the aspirations of its founder Mrs. Comfort Akua Addai-Mensah. At first it started because 
    she realized parents didn’t have anywhere to leave their kids to go to work or the market place and so it was to be a 
    simple very affordable day care. After a while, as she realized the difference it was making in parents lives, and the 
    growth she was seeing in the kids who otherwise wouldn’t be going to school, she decided there has to be something more. 
    It had to go beyond helping parents and making an impact in the kids lives, it had to be a total transformational 
    place which should have a lasting impact in the community and the people who live in that community. 
    But to do that, it would have to come at a cost so without hesitation, she started saving up all her money from her 
    career in health care with one aim: to build a transformational institution. Till this day, if you ask her why she 
    built the school, she modestly says “ To be surrounded by kids in her retirement so she can witness their growth and 
    transformation on a daily basis with the hope that they in turn can help transform their community”. It is on this basis 
    that the school exist, constantly thrive to exceed, and will continue to exist as an institution. Every student, 
    every staff member that walks on its’ grounds will be indoctrinated on the principles and foundation she has laid out: 
    A transformational mindset – otherwise there is no reason to be part of the program whether you are a student or a staff 
    member. It is our sole and most important reason to expel a member. Not because you are not a good student, not because 
    you can’t afford it, not because you were misbehaving. Simply because you stopped to or didn’t want to maintain a 
    transformational mindset. Without compromising our principles, our foundation continuously adjust and innovate. An 
    environment of nimbleness not just in the operations of the school but the mindset amongst the students that walk through 
    its grounds as they look to the future.</p>

    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Our Teachers</h3>
      <p>At Dieux Vivant, we take great pride in building a well-educated, well-trained, caring, and motivating team of 
        support. We ensure that all teachers meet our qualifications, as well as passing stringent background screenings, 
        health screenings, and a thorough review of personal references. With extensive training, orientation, and 
        continuing education programs, we develop and train the total teacher, so that children are sharing their days 
        with DV-trained learning advocates. </p>
    <p>All lead teachers are required to have a degree in childhood education or a closely-related field, and they are 
      carefully selected based on their education, previous teaching experience, and ability to bond and effectively 
      communicate with their students. Above all, we choose faculty members who love the childhood profession and have a 
      strong, positive curiosity about life that sparks confidence and joy in those around them. This high standard is one 
      of many that sets DV apart.</p>
    
    <p>Each day, your child will interact with his or her lead teacher, who will stay with the classroom for continuity 
      and consistency. With a faculty of teacher’s assistants both locally and those from the US and Europe who make 
      teaching visits to share ideas and constant support from the school leadership team, kitchen manager, and enrichment 
      program teachers, we have a large team of confident, capable faculty members to ensure that your child’s day 
      progresses smoothly.</p>
